            <h3 style="margin: 10px;">This is your standard Clash Royale arena! it has a total of 548 playable 
                tiles, but some arenas have 528 playable tiles. The idea of the game is to place troops in these 
                tiles and attempt to destroy your opponents crown towers. Determining the dimensions of these tile will 
                be a crucial step in finding out if Clash Royale has realistic physics.

            <h3 style="margin: 10;">According to the following images a hog is approximately 1.8 tiles long. 
              I did some research and found out that the hogs in Clash Royale are most likely "Domestic pigs"
              which vary in size from 90-180cm in length. On average they are 135 cm in length.

            <h3 style="margin: 10px;">Through simple algebra I have deduced that one tile is approximately 75cm in length and width.</h3>

    <p style="margin: 10px;">A prince is placed onto the board. There is a 1 second delay before it starts moving at a speed of
    xtiles/s before accelerating to a speed of ytiles/s a while later it encounters a hog rider after 
    crossing a bridge that was 2 tiles long and instatnly comes to a halt to attack it. The hog rider 
    survives on 1 hpand runs past the prince causing the prince to chase it in the opposite direction.
    The prince starts slow but accelerates to an increased speed before the hog rider meets the terrible fate
    of being unalived by a tower. Following that the prince nimbly makes a 180 degree turn without losing speed.
    The prince then continues to move at a constant velocity until it crosses the bridge and makes a sharp 90 degree
    turn while maintaining the same speed it eventually collides with an enemy mortar bring it to a complete stop.<br><br>
    With the given information answer the following questions:<br><br>
      
    a) what was the average velocity of the prince since it got placed(in tiles/s)? Round to 2 decimal numbers<br>
      </p>
    <button id="buttonA" onclick="showAnswerA()" style="margin: 10px;">show answer</button>
        <p id="AnswerA" style="display: none; margin: 10px;">I counted 24 tiles in a span of 16 seconds so 24/16 = 1.5 tiles/s</p>
      <script>
        function showAnswerA() {
          const answer = document.getElementById("AnswerA")
          const button = document.getElementById("buttonA")
          if (answer.style.display === "none") {
            answer.style.display = "block";
            button.textContent = "hide answer";
          } else {
            answer.style.display = "none";
            button.textContent = "show answer";
          }
        }
        </script>
      <p style="margin: 10px;"><br>b) how many times did the prince accelerate (in the positive or negative direction)?</p>
    <button id="buttonB" onclick="showAnswerB()" style="margin: 10px;">show answer</button>
        <p id="AnswerB" style="display: none; margin: 10px;">10 times (if you pay close attention you will notice when it turns towards the mortar it performed 3 separate turns which I counted as changing acceleration 3 times.)</p>
      <script>
        function showAnswerB() {
          const answer = document.getElementById("AnswerB")
          const button = document.getElementById("buttonB")
          if (answer.style.display === "none") {
            answer.style.display = "block";
            button.textContent = "hide answer";
          } else {
            answer.style.display = "none";
            button.textContent = "show answer";
          }
        }

      <p style="margin: 10px;">Observe the movements of the hog rider in the arena. It travels at a constant speed but at an inconsistent direction. 
        Thus creating 3 separate vectors which we can combine to find its average velocity and speed. Since we are given its x (width of arena) 
        and its y (length of the arena) magnitude as well as the time it took to reach the tower. With these pieces we can quantify the movements of the hog rider.

      <p style="margin: 10px;">While playing some games I noticed certain troops show signs of the law of conservation of mass.
        These two troops demonstrated Newton's third law, the recoil law. When they launched their respective projectiles they would shift backwards
        a fraction of a tile(experience recoil).<br>Can you guess which ones?</p>
