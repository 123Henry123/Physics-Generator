// Tips:
//  - Highlight multiple lines and press Tab or Shift+Tab to indent and un-indent them all an once
//  - You can change the URL of your generator by clicking the "settings" button in the top-right
//  - You can use the sparkle button in the lower-right of the screen to ask the AI to adjust the visual design of your generator.
//  - Add background images, fonts, and other stuff with plugins:  perchance.org/plugins
//  - Here are some generators you might like to import:  perchance.org/useful-generators
//  - Read this page after reading the tutorial:  perchance.org/examples
//  - There's a gear button in the top-left which you can use to make the lines wrap around when they reach the edge of the screen, and to change the font size. Also, if you add   $output=[this.joinItems("<br>")]   as the first or last item in your list, then writing [yourListName] will magically output all of the items joined together with <br> (which means "line break" in HTML - i.e. a line separator), rather than outputting a random item from the "yourListName" list.
