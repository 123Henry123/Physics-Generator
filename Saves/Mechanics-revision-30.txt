// Tips:
//  - Highlight multiple lines and press Tab or Shift+Tab to indent and un-indent them all an once
//  - You can change the URL of your generator by clicking the "settings" button in the top-right
//  - You can use the sparkle button in the lower-right of the screen to ask the AI to adjust the visual design of your generator.
//  - Add background images, fonts, and other stuff with plugins:  perchance.org/plugins
//  - Here are some generators you might like to import:  perchance.org/useful-generators
//  - Read this page after reading the tutorial:  perchance.org/examples
//  - There's a gear button in the top-left which you can use to make the lines wrap around when they reach the edge of the screen, and to change the font size. Also, if you add   $output=[this.joinItems("<br>")]   as the first or last item in your list, then writing [yourListName] will magically output all of the items joined together with <br> (which means "line break" in HTML - i.e. a line separator), rather than outputting a random item from the "yourListName" list.

    <h4>Acceleration, velocity, and speed</h4>
    <p>A prince is placed onto the board. There is a 1 second delay before it starts moving at a speed of<br>
    xtiles/s before accelerating to a speed of ytiles/s a while later it encounters a hog rider after <br>
    crossing a bridge that was 2 tiles long and instatnly comes to a halt to attack it. The hog rider <br>
    survives on 1 hpand runs past the prince causing the prince to chase it in the opposite direction.<br>
    The prince starts slow but accelerates to an increased speed before the hog rider meets the terrible fate<br>
    of being unalived by a tower. Following that the prince nimbly makes a 180° turn without losing speed.<br>
    The prince then continues to move at a constant velocity until it crosses the bridge and makes a sharp 90°<br>
    turn while maintaining the same speed it eventually collides with an enemy mortar bring it to a complete stop.<br><br>
      
      With the given information answer the following questions:<br><br>
      
    a) what was the average velocity of the prince since it got placed(in tiles/s)? Round to 2 decimal numbers<br>
      </p>
    <button id="buttonA" onclick="showAnswerA()">show answer</button>
        <p id="AnswerA" style="display: none">I counter 24 tiles in a span of 16 seconds so 24/16 = 1.5 tiles/s</p>
      <script>
        function showAnswerA() {
          const answer = document.getElementById("AnswerA")
          const button = document.getElementById("buttonA")
          if (answer.style.display === "none") {
            answer.style.display = "block";
            button.textContent = "hide answer";
          } else {
            answer.style.display = "none";
            button.textContent = "show answer";
          }
        }
      </script
      
    <p><br>b) how many times did the prince accelerate (in the positive or negative direction)?</p>
    <button id="buttonB" onclick="showAnswerB()">show answer</button>
        <p id="AnswerB" style="display: none">10 times if you pay close attention you will notice when it turns towards the mortar<br>it does so in 3 seperate changes in velocity which I counted as changing acceleration 3 times.</p>
      <script>
        function showAnswerB() {
          const answer = document.getElementById("AnswerB")
          const button = document.getElementById("buttonB")
          if (answer.style.display === "none") {
            answer.style.display = "block";
            button.textContent = "hide answer";
          } else {
            answer.style.display = "none";
            button.textContent = "show answer";
          }
        }
      </script>
