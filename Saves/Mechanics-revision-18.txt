// Tips:
//  - Highlight multiple lines and press Tab or Shift+Tab to indent and un-indent them all an once
//  - You can change the URL of your generator by clicking the "settings" button in the top-right
//  - You can use the sparkle button in the lower-right of the screen to ask the AI to adjust the visual design of your generator.
//  - Add background images, fonts, and other stuff with plugins:  perchance.org/plugins
//  - Here are some generators you might like to import:  perchance.org/useful-generators
//  - Read this page after reading the tutorial:  perchance.org/examples
//  - There's a gear button in the top-left which you can use to make the lines wrap around when they reach the edge of the screen, and to change the font size. Also, if you add   $output=[this.joinItems("<br>")]   as the first or last item in your list, then writing [yourListName] will magically output all of the items joined together with <br> (which means "line break" in HTML - i.e. a line separator), rather than outputting a random item from the "yourListName" list.

    <h4>Acceleration, velocity, and speed</h4>
    <p>A prince is placed onto the board. There is a 1 second delay before it starts moving at a speed of <br>
    xtiles/s before accelerating to a speed of ytiles/s a while later it encounters a hog rider and instatnly <br>
    comes to a halt to attack it. The hog rider survives on 1 hp and runs past the prince causing the prince to <br>
    chase it in the opposite direction. The prince starts slow but accelerates to an increased speed before the hog <br>
    rider meets the terrible fate of being unalived by a tower. Following that the prince nimbly makes <br>
    a 180Â° turn without losing speed. The prince then continues to move at a constant speed until it collides with <br>
    an enemy mortar bring it to a complete stop.<br><br>
      
      With the given information answer the following questions:<br><br>
      
    a) what was the average velocity of the prince (in tiles/s)? Round to the nearest whole number<br>
    b) how many times did the prince accelerate (in the positive or negative direction)?</p>
